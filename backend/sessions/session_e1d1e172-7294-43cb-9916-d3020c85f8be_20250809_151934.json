You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, motherfucker.

Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking website. Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some motherfucker jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.</p>\n        \n        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>\n        \n        <h2>It's fucking lightweight</h2>\n        \n        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site.

You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say \"Hi.\" at 100px height at the beginning of your site?

It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass browser know what the fuck's in this fucking site. That's semantics, motherfucker.</p>\n        \n        <p>It has content on the fucking screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>\n        \n        <p>Cross-browser compatibility?
