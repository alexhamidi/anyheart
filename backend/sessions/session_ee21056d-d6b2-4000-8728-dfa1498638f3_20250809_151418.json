Are. Over-designing. Look at this. It's a nice website. Why do you need to animate a trendy banner flag when I hover over it? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your site, and some visitor using an iPad with fat fingers will never see that. Not to mention blind people will never see that, but they don't see any of your content.</p>\n        \n        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website.

Responsive means that it responds to whatever screen size it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a Tamagotchi.</p>\n        \n        <h2>It works</h2>\n        \n        <p>Look at this. You can read it ... that is, if you can read. It makes sense.

Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>\n        \n        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this in IE6. I dare you.</p>\n        \n        <h2>This is a website. Look at it.

All you have ever seen are bastardizations of what should be text communicating a message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's beautiful.</p>\n        \n        <h3>Yes, this is satire</h3>\n        \n        <p>I'm not actually saying your site should look like this.
